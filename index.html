    <article>
      <p>This morning I woke up to dozens of messages from students who had read an article titled “Please Don’t Learn to Code.”
      </p>
      <p>At first, I assumed <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/" title="Jeff Atwood">Jeff Atwood’s 2012 article</a> had spontaneously reappeared on Reddit. But no — this was a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code" title="Tech Crunch">brand new Tech Crunch article</a> of the same name, which echoed Atwood’s assertion that encouraging everyone to learn programming is like encouraging everyone to learn plumbing.
